# Better Eyes
Changes Eyes of Ender functionality to be more user-friendly

Download the mod from CurseForge: [BetterEyes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-eyes)

- Release `bettereyes-1.16.5-1.0.jar` supports MC Version 1.16.5
- Release `bettereyes-1.18.2-1.0.jar` supports MC Version 1.18.2

Eyes of Ender no longer launch from the player as an entity/projectile, instead, they generate a notification message above the hotbar "nudging" the user in the same direction the eye would have traveled. This works in a similar way to how rune talismans work in Runescape.

Particles spawn in an area around the player when the Eye of Ender is right-clicked. The more spread out the particles are, the farther you are from the nearest stronghold.

When the player right-clicks an eye, various messages may be displayed in chat:
- Direction: "You rub the Eye of Ender, it pulled north-west."
- Nearby: "You rub the Eye of Ender and it shakes violently in your hand."
- Nothing Found: "You rub the Eye of Ender and it does not move."

The directions indicated are accurate to the 16th division. Such as:
- North
- East by South-East
- South-West
